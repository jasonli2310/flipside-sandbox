          <h3 class="no-center">Why Flipside?</h3>
          <p class="no-center text">Democracy requires many different pieces to function effectively, from constitutionally guaranteed civil rights to elected government. But an important piece that often gets missed is the necessity for the electorate to be able to effectively deliberate and debate public issues. For the best ideas to win and for our society to move forward, each of us needs to be able to better understand and persuade people who have views we think are wrong, as well as be exposed to new ideas we might find compelling.</p>
          <p class="no-center text">Most of the time, though, that process can be incredibly annoying. Trying to go out of your way to read viewpoints you don’t agree with means sifting through dozens of articles and forums just to find something relevant. And the worst part is when you get there, what you often find is terribly written or just doesn’t make sense to you. That’s why we’re building Flipside. We want to make it easy and interesting for you to learn about different viewpoints without feeling like you’re pulling teeth. We want to find you pieces of writing that will fascinate you even if you disagree with the argument. We want to make open-mindedness fun.</p>
          <p class="no-center text">Of course, we understand there are many viewpoints that may seem harmful, stupid, or misguided. What we’d like to note, though, is that even if you are perfectly sure that your beliefs are the right ones, it actually helps the issues we care most about for us to listen to and talk to people who disagree with us. The more we interact with people we disagree with, the more we can understand why people might think differently and allow us to better explain our perspective to those people. So give it a shot, and let us know what you think.</p>
          <h3 class="no-center">Who We Are</h3>
          <p class="no-center text">Our team spans the political spectrum, but we all agree that surfing through different opinions online as well as contributing your own is prohibitively frustrating. We’re dismayed by the fact that media corporations are rewarded for bias and sensationalism and that toxic partisanship has reached an all-time high. Flipside is a platform we’re building that fights this by making it easier to learn about different perspectives.</p>
          <p class="no-center text">We’re tackling a big challenge, but we feel up to the task, largely because we’re all personally invested in improving how we exchange ideas. We are a team of social scientists, engineers, and political junkies who believe that by introducing new ways to curate high-quality content and interact with opinions, we can use technology to bridge divides rather than deepen them.</p>
